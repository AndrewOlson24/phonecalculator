# Overview

I built an calculator app in Kotlin using android studios. It has 5 buttons, add, substract, multiply, divide and exponents. it can do simple math, just type in 2 different
numbers and the program will do the rest.

I used view.OnclickerListen {} which allowed me to create the 5 buttons.

I used Kotlin and Android Studio to bulld the app. I also used an emulator of a
android phone to create the app and figure out if the stuff works. I used widgets, math and appcompat
